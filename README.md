# Snake Game with Reinforcement Learning


## Description

Snake Game with Reinforcement Learning is a project that combines classic game development with artificial intelligence. The Snake game is implemented using the Pygame library, and an AI agent is trained to play the game using the Q-learning algorithm powered by PyTorch. The goal is to showcase the implementation of a reinforcement learning algorithm in a gaming environment.

## Features

- **Snake Game:** Classic Snake game implemented using Pygame.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Q-learning algorithm applied for training an AI agent.
- **PyTorch Integration:** Utilizing PyTorch for neural network implementation.
- **Flexible and Extendable:** Easily extendable for experimenting with different algorithms or game modifications.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iarslankhalid/RL_snake_game.git
   cd RL_snake_game
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. **Setup:** Complete all the Installation process
2. Run `agent.py` file
3. You can use the pre-trained parameters by setting `LOAD_PREVIOUS_MODEL = True` in `model.py`
4. Or you can train the snake from start.
5. **Explore & Experiment:**
     - Tweak parameters and configurations in model.py for customization.
     - Extend the project by implementing additional features or experimenting with different reinforcement learning algorithms.
